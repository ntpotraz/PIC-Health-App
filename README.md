## Future Feature Ideas

- Fetch calendar events right at startup
- Store each calendar and the calendars that are being selected into seperate variables or states for faster calendar filtering.
- Have the calendars selected by default at startup. This will most likely require a different dropdown component
- Setup a database so that the users can start "Liking" events and have it persist and sync accross all users in order to guage interests in events
- Support repeated events. Right now if you make an event on Google Calendar that repeats, it'll only show up on the on the first day.
- Have the location on events be clickable and bring up the address in Google/Apple Maps
- Allow for users to have their own event list that keeps track of the events that they plan on attending
- Allow user accounts, either custom or connect Google accounts.
    - Using Google accounts could also also allow for events that the user is planning on attending to be added to their own personal Calendar
